# abramsimon-com

This project is a testing ground for different technologies that I want to better understand.  The best way to exercise
these technologies is by having a real project that is both fun and open ended.  As such, I have chosen to create a
not-remotely-intelligent "bot" that can be interviewed in my absence (inspired by [Bipol as a Service](https://bipolasaservice.herokuapp.com/)).

So far, this project is composed of:

## User Interface

The interactive interface is found at [AbramSimon.com](http://www.abramsimon.com).  Created using 
[React](https://reactjs.org/)+[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and [Material UI](https://www.material-ui.com/)
and hosted on [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).

## API

The API has not been created yet.  Sorry.

The plan is to make multiple backends, in [.Net Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core), [Go](https://golang.org/), and whatever
other language/framework I find interesting.
